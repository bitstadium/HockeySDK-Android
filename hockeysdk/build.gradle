If the user starts the app again, they will be asked asked to submit the crash report to HockeyApp. This works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to Google Play or other app stores. Crash logs contain viable information for you to help resolve the issue. Furthermore, you as a developer can add additional information to the report as well.\n' +

If yes, it will show a dialog to users and let them see the release notes, the version history and start the installation process right away. You can even force the installation of certain updates.\n' +

Measure customer engagement through session count. Add custom tracking calls to learn which features your users are actually using.  This feature requires a minimum API level of 14 (Android 4.x Ice Cream Sandwich).\n' +
